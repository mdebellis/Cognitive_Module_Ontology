# Cognitive_Module_Ontology
An ontology in the Web Ontology Language to model the concept of cognitive modules from evolutionary psychology
An important concept in Evolutionary Psychology is the cognitive module. Cognitive modules are hypothesized to be innate in the human genome and form the foundation for basic cognitive functions. Examples include language, causality, contact mechanics, folk biology, and basic ethical concepts. This concept is an extension of the work in Biolinguistics pioneered by Chomsky where an innate language faculty is hypothesized to exist (known as Universal Grammar in the past and I-language in present works) and is an alternative approach to the ”blank slate” model of psychology that hypothesizes all learning and knowledge to be based on a single general learning process such as Stimulus Response conditioning. Although there has been extensive research on these modules, no one to my knowledge has created a formal model of them. This  ontology that creates a model based on structures and processes that are commonly ascribed to them in evolutionary and cognitive psychology research. This is one example of how OWL can be a powerful tool for the cognitive and social sciences. One of the biggest obstacles to scientific theories in the “soft” sciences is the difficulty of defining rigorous, testable models. OWL provides a tool that is abstract enough that it can model concepts in the cognitive and social sciences.
